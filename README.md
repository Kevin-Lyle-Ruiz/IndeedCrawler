# Indeed Job Crawler

This program searches through [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com) for job listings. The jobs to look for as well the 
location to look for the jobs is up to the user. The search results is then output to a CSV file and then the user 
is then given the option to send the results to an email of the user's choice.

**Note**: The search query is strict in that if a user is searching for **Software Developer**, the crawler will 
          only output the results to the CSV file if the job title contains the words **Software** or **Developer**,
          ignoring case-sensitivity.
